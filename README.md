# Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease using LSTM and CNN

## Overview

This project explores the application of deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for early detection of Alzheimer's Disease. The goal is to develop models that can analyze neuroimaging data to predict the presence of Alzheimer's disease at its early stages.

### Key Features

- **LSTM Model**: Utilizes LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies in neuroimaging sequences.
- **CNN Model**: Applies Convolutional Neural Networks to extract spatial features from neuroimaging data.
- **Comparative Study**: Evaluates and compares the performance of LSTM and CNN models against baseline methods.
